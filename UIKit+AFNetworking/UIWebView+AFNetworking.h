 @param request A URL request identifying the location of the content to load. This must not be `nil`.
 @param progress A block object to be called when an undetermined number of bytes have been downloaded from the server. This block has no return value and takes three arguments: the number of bytes read since the last time the download progress block was called, the total bytes read, and the total bytes expected to be read during the request, as initially determined by the expected content size of the `NSHTTPURLResponse` object. This block may be called multiple times, and will execute on the main thread.
 @param success A block object to be executed when the request finishes loading successfully. This block returns the HTML string to be loaded by the web view, and takes two arguments: the response, and the response string.
 @param failure A block object to be executed when the request operation finishes unsuccessfully, or that finishes successfully, but encountered an error while parsing the response data. This block has no return value and takes a single argument: the error that occurred.
