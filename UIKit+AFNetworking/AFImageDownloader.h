 The `AFImageDownloadReceipt` is an object vended by the `AFImageDownloader` when starting a data task. It can be used to cancel active tasks running on the `AFImageDownloader` session.

The `AFImageDownloader` is optimized to handle duplicate task scenarios as well as pending versus active downloads.
