/**
 `AFNetworkActivityIndicatorManager` manages the state of the network activity indicator in the status bar. When enabled, it will listen for notifications indicating that a session task has started or finished, and start or stop animating the indicator accordingly. The number of active requests is incremented and decremented much like a stack or a semaphore, and the activity indicator will animate so long as that number is greater than zero.

 You should enable the shared instance of `AFNetworkActivityIndicatorManager` when your application finishes launching. In `AppDelegate application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` you can do so with the following code:

    [[AFNetworkActivityIndicatorManager sharedManager] setEnabled:YES];

 By setting `enabled` to `YES` for `sharedManager`, the network activity indicator will show and hide automatically as requests start and finish. You should not ever need to call `incrementActivityCount` or `decrementActivityCount` yourself.

 See the Apple Human Interface Guidelines section about the Network Activity Indicator for more information:
 http://developer.apple.com/library/iOS/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/UIElementGuidelines/UIElementGuidelines.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH13-SW44

 Apple's HIG describes the following:

If the operation finishes sooner than that, you don’t have to show the network activity indicator, because the indicator is likely to disappear before users notice its presence.
