/**
 This category adds methods to the UIKit framework's `UIWebView` class. The methods in this category provide increased control over the request cycle, including progress monitoring and success / failure handling.

 @discussion When using these category methods, make sure to assign `delegate` for the web view, which implements `–webView:shouldStartLoadWithRequest:navigationType:` appropriately. This allows for tapped links to be loaded through AFNetworking, and can ensure that `canGoBack` & `canGoForward` update their values correctly.
