/**
 `AFHTTPClient` captures the common patterns of communicating with an web application over HTTP. It encapsulates information like base URL, authorization credentials, and HTTP headers, and uses them to construct and manage the execution of HTTP request operations.
 
 ## Automatic Content Parsing
 
 Instances of `AFHTTPClient` may specify which types of requests it expects and should handle by registering HTTP operation classes for automatic parsing. Registered classes will determine whether they can handle a particular request, and then construct a request operation accordingly in `enqueueHTTPRequestOperationWithRequest:success:failure`. See `AFHTTPClientOperation` for further details.
 
 ## Subclassing Notes
 
 In most cases, one should create an `AFHTTPClient` subclass for each website or web application that your application communicates with. It is often useful, also, to define a class method that returns a singleton shared HTTP client in each subclass, that persists authentication credentials and other configuration across the entire application.
 
 ## Methods to Override
 
 To change the behavior of all url request construction for an `AFHTTPClient` subclass, override `requestWithMethod:path:parameters`.
 
 To change the behavior of all request operation construction for an `AFHTTPClient` subclass, override `enqueueHTTPRequestOperationWithRequest:success:failure`.
 
 ## Default Headers
 
 By default, `AFHTTPClient` sets the following HTTP headers:
 
 - `Accept-Encoding: gzip`
 - `Accept-Language: ([NSLocale preferredLanguages]), en-us;q=0.8`
 - `User-Agent: (generated user agent)`
 
 You can override these HTTP headers or define new ones using `setDefaultHeader:value:`.
 
 ## URL Construction Using Relative Paths
 
 Both `requestWithMethod:path:parameters` and `multipartFormRequestWithMethod:path:parameters:constructingBodyWithBlock:` construct URLs from the path relative to the `baseURL`, using `NSURL +URLWithString:relativeToURL:`. Below are a few examples of how `baseURL` and relative paths interract:
 
    NSURL *baseURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example.com/v1/"];
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"foo" relativeToURL:baseURL];                     // http://example.com/v1/foo
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"foo?bar=baz" relativeToURL:baseURL];             // http://example.com/v1/foo?bar=baz
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"/foo" relativeToURL:baseURL];                    // http://example.com/foo
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"foo/" relativeToURL:baseURL];                    // http://example.com/v1/foo
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"/foo/" relativeToURL:baseURL];                   // http://example.com/foo/
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example2.com/" relativeToURL:baseURL];    // http://example2.com/
