/**
 `AFHTTPClient` encapsulates the common patterns of communicating with an web application over HTTP, including request creation, response serialization, network reachability monitoring, and security, as well as both request operation and session task management.

 ## Subclassing Notes

 In most cases, one should create an `AFHTTPClient` subclass for each website or web application that your application communicates with. It is often useful, also, to define a class method that returns a singleton shared HTTP client in each subclass, that persists authentication credentials and other configuration across the entire application.

 ## Methods to Override

 To change the behavior of all url request construction for an `AFHTTPClient` subclass, override `requestWithMethod:URLString:parameters`.

 To change the behavior of all request operation construction for an `AFHTTPClient` subclass, override `HTTPRequestOperationWithRequest:success:failure`.

 To change the behavior of all data task operation construction, which is also used in the `GET` / `POST` / et al. convenience methods, override `dataTaskWithRequest:success:failure:`.
 
 ## Serialization
 
 Requests created by an HTTP client will contain default headers and encode parameters according to the `requestSerializer` property, which is an object conforming to `<AFURLRequestSerialization>`. Responses received from the server are automatically validated and serialized by the `responseSerializers` property, which is an object conforming to `<AFURLResponseSerialization>`

 ## URL Construction Using Relative Paths

 Both `-requestWithMethod:URLString:parameters:` and `-multipartFormRequestWithMethod:URLString:parameters:constructingBodyWithBlock:` construct URLs from the path relative to the `-baseURL`, using `NSURL +URLWithString:relativeToURL:`, when provided. If `baseURL` is `nil`, `path` needs to resolve to a valid `NSURL` object using `NSURL +URLWithString:`.
 
 Below are a few examples of how `baseURL` and relative paths interact:

    NSURL *baseURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example.com/v1/"];
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"foo" relativeToURL:baseURL];                  // http://example.com/v1/foo
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"foo?bar=baz" relativeToURL:baseURL];          // http://example.com/v1/foo?bar=baz
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"/foo" relativeToURL:baseURL];                 // http://example.com/foo
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"foo/" relativeToURL:baseURL];                 // http://example.com/v1/foo
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"/foo/" relativeToURL:baseURL];                // http://example.com/foo/
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example2.com/" relativeToURL:baseURL]; // http://example2.com/

 Also important to note is that a trailing slash will be added to any `baseURL` without one. This would otherwise cause unexpected behavior when constructing URLs using paths without a leading slash.
 
 ## Network Reachability Monitoring
 
 Network reachability status and change monitoring is available to any `AFHTTPClient` created with a specified `baseURL`. Applications may choose to monitor network reachability conditions in order to prevent or suspend any outbound requests.
 
 The current reachability status can be accessed with the `networkReachabilityStatus` property. Changes can be monitored by doing `setReachabilityStatusChangeBlock:`, or listening for an `AFNetworkingReachabilityDidChangeNotification` notification.

 ## NSCoding / NSCopying Conformance

 `AFHTTPClient`  conforms to the `NSCoding` and `NSCopying` protocols, allowing operations to be archived to disk, and copied in memory, respectively. There are a few minor caveats to keep in mind, however:

 - Archives and copies of HTTP clients will be initialized with an empty operation queue.
 - NSCoding cannot serialize / deserialize block properties, so an archive of an HTTP client will not include any reachability callback block that may be set.

 ## Network Reachability

 The following constants are provided by `AFHTTPClient` as possible network reachability statuses.

 enum {
    AFNetworkReachabilityStatusUnknown,
    AFNetworkReachabilityStatusNotReachable,
    AFNetworkReachabilityStatusReachableViaWWAN,
    AFNetworkReachabilityStatusReachableViaWiFi,
 }

 `AFNetworkReachabilityStatusUnknown`
 The `baseURL` host reachability is not known.

 `AFNetworkReachabilityStatusNotReachable`
 The `baseURL` host cannot be reached.

 `AFNetworkReachabilityStatusReachableViaWWAN`
 The `baseURL` host can be reached via a cellular connection, such as EDGE or GPRS.

 `AFNetworkReachabilityStatusReachableViaWiFi`
 The `baseURL` host can be reached via a Wi-Fi connection.

 ### Keys for Notification UserInfo Dictionary

 Strings that are used as keys in a `userInfo` dictionary in a network reachability status change notification.

 `AFNetworkingReachabilityNotificationStatusItem`
 A key in the userInfo dictionary in a `AFNetworkingReachabilityDidChangeNotification` notification.
 The corresponding value is an `NSNumber` object representing the `AFNetworkReachabilityStatus` value for the current reachability status.

 @warning In order for network reachability to be monitored, include the `SystemConfiguration` framework in the active target's "Link Binary With Library" build phase, and add `#import <SystemConfiguration/SystemConfiguration.h>` to the header prefix of the project (`Prefix.pch`).

 Throttles request bandwidth by limiting the packet size and adding a delay for each chunk read from the upload stream.

 When uploading over a 3G or EDGE connection, requests may fail with "request body stream exhausted". Setting a maximum packet size and delay according to the recommended values (`kAFUploadStream3GSuggestedPacketSize` and `kAFUploadStream3GSuggestedDelay`) lowers the risk of the input stream exceeding its allocated bandwidth. Unfortunately, there is no definite way to distinguish between a 3G, EDGE, or LTE connection over `NSURLConnection`. As such, it is not recommended that you throttle bandwidth based solely on network reachability. Instead, you should consider checking for the "request body stream exhausted" in a failure block, and then retrying the request with throttled bandwidth.
