#import "QRunLoopOperation.h"

/*
    QHTTPOperation is a general purpose NSOperation that runs an HTTP request. 
    You initialise it with an HTTP request and then, when you run the operation, 
    it sends the request and gathers the response.  It is quite a complex 
    object because it handles a wide variety of edge cases, but it's very 
    easy to use in simple cases:

    1. create the operation with the URL you want to get
    
    op = [[[QHTTPOperation alloc] initWithURL:url] autorelease];
    
    2. set up any non-default parameters, for example, set which HTTP 
       content types are acceptable
    
    op.acceptableContentTypes = [NSSet setWithObject:@"text/html"];
    
    3. enqueue the operation
    
    [queue addOperation:op];
    
    4. finally, when the operation is done, use the lastResponse and 
       error properties to find out how things went
    
    As mentioned above, QHTTPOperation is very general purpose.  There are a 
    large number of configuration and result options available to you.
    
    o You can specify a NSURLRequest rather than just a URL.
    
    o You can configure the run loop and modes on which the NSURLConnection is 
      scheduled.
    
    o You can specify what HTTP status codes and content types are OK.
      
    o You can set an authentication delegate to handle authentication challenges.
    
    o You can accumulate responses in memory or in an NSOutputStream. 
    
    o For in-memory responses, you can specify a default response size 
      (used to size the response buffer) and a maximum response size 
      (to prevent unbounded memory use).
    
    o You can get at the last request and the last response, to track 
      redirects.

    o There are a variety of funky debugging options to simulator errors 
      and delays.
      
    Finally, it's perfectly reasonable to subclass QHTTPOperation to meet you 
    own specific needs.  Specifically, it's common for the subclass to 
    override -connection:didReceiveResponse: in order to setup the output 
    stream based on the specific details of the response.
