/**
 `AFHTTPRequestOperationManager` encapsulates the common patterns of communicating with an web application over HTTP, including request creation, response serialization, network reachability monitoring, and security, as well as request operation management.

 ## Subclassing Notes
 
 Developers targeting iOS 7 or Mac OS X 10.9 or later that deal extensively with a web service are encouraged to subclass `AFHTTPSessionManager`, providing a class method that returns a shared singleton object on which authentication and other configuration can be shared across the application.
 
 For developers targeting iOS 6 or Mac OS X 10.8 or earlier, `AFHTTPRequestOperationManager` may be used to similar effect.
 
 ## Methods to Override

 To change the behavior of all request operation construction for an `AFHTTPRequestOperationManager` subclass, override `HTTPRequestOperationWithRequest:success:failure`.

 ## Serialization
 
 Requests created by an HTTP client will contain default headers and encode parameters according to the `requestSerializer` property, which is an object conforming to `<AFURLRequestSerialization>`. 
 
 Responses received from the server are automatically validated and serialized by the `responseSerializers` property, which is an object conforming to `<AFURLResponseSerialization>`

 ## URL Construction Using Relative Paths

 For HTTP convenience methods, the request serializer constructs URLs from the path relative to the `-baseURL`, using `NSURL +URLWithString:relativeToURL:`, when provided. If `baseURL` is `nil`, `path` needs to resolve to a valid `NSURL` object using `NSURL +URLWithString:`.

 Below are a few examples of how `baseURL` and relative paths interact:

    NSURL *baseURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example.com/v1/"];
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"foo" relativeToURL:baseURL];                  // http://example.com/v1/foo
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"foo?bar=baz" relativeToURL:baseURL];          // http://example.com/v1/foo?bar=baz
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"/foo" relativeToURL:baseURL];                 // http://example.com/foo
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"foo/" relativeToURL:baseURL];                 // http://example.com/v1/foo
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"/foo/" relativeToURL:baseURL];                // http://example.com/foo/
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example2.com/" relativeToURL:baseURL]; // http://example2.com/

 Also important to note is that a trailing slash will be added to any `baseURL` without one. This would otherwise cause unexpected behavior when constructing URLs using paths without a leading slash.

 ## Network Reachability Monitoring

 Network reachability status and change monitoring is available through the `reachabilityManager` property. Applications may choose to monitor network reachability conditions in order to prevent or suspend any outbound requests. See `AFNetworkReachabilityManager` for more details.

 ## NSCoding & NSCopying Caveats

 `AFHTTPRequestOperationManager`  conforms to the `NSCoding` and `NSCopying` protocols, allowing operations to be archived to disk, and copied in memory, respectively. There are a few minor caveats to keep in mind, however:

 - Archives and copies of HTTP clients will be initialized with an empty operation queue.
 - NSCoding cannot serialize / deserialize block properties, so an archive of an HTTP client will not include any reachability callback block that may be set.
