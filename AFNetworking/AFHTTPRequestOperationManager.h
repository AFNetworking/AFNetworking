/**
 `AFHTTPRequestOperationManager` encapsulates the common patterns of communicating with a web application over HTTP, including request creation, response serialization, network reachability monitoring, and security, as well as request operation management.

 ## Subclassing Notes
 
 Developers targeting iOS 7 or Mac OS X 10.9 or later that deal extensively with a web service are encouraged to subclass `AFHTTPSessionManager`, providing a class method that returns a shared singleton object on which authentication and other configuration can be shared across the application.
 
 For developers targeting iOS 6 or Mac OS X 10.8 or earlier, `AFHTTPRequestOperationManager` may be used to similar effect.
 
 ## Methods to Override

 To change the behavior of all request operation construction for an `AFHTTPRequestOperationManager` subclass, override `HTTPRequestOperationWithRequest:success:failure`.

 ## Serialization
 
 Requests created by an HTTP client will contain default headers and encode parameters according to the `requestSerializer` property, which is an object conforming to `<AFURLRequestSerialization>`. 
 
 Responses received from the server are automatically validated and serialized by the `responseSerializers` property, which is an object conforming to `<AFURLResponseSerialization>`

 ## URL Construction Using Relative Paths

 For HTTP convenience methods, the request serializer constructs URLs from the path relative to the `-baseURL`, using `NSURL +URLWithString:relativeToURL:`, when provided. If `baseURL` is `nil`, `path` needs to resolve to a valid `NSURL` object using `NSURL +URLWithString:`.

 Below are a few examples of how `baseURL` and relative paths interact:

    NSURL *baseURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example.com/v1/"];
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"foo" relativeToURL:baseURL];                  // http://example.com/v1/foo
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"foo?bar=baz" relativeToURL:baseURL];          // http://example.com/v1/foo?bar=baz
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"/foo" relativeToURL:baseURL];                 // http://example.com/foo
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"foo/" relativeToURL:baseURL];                 // http://example.com/v1/foo
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"/foo/" relativeToURL:baseURL];                // http://example.com/foo/
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example2.com/" relativeToURL:baseURL]; // http://example2.com/

 Also important to note is that a trailing slash will be added to any `baseURL` without one. This would otherwise cause unexpected behavior when constructing URLs using paths without a leading slash.

 ## Network Reachability Monitoring

 Network reachability status and change monitoring is available through the `reachabilityManager` property. Applications may choose to monitor network reachability conditions in order to prevent or suspend any outbound requests. See `AFNetworkReachabilityManager` for more details.

 ## NSCoding & NSCopying Caveats

 `AFHTTPRequestOperationManager`  conforms to the `NSCoding` and `NSCopying` protocols, allowing operations to be archived to disk, and copied in memory, respectively. There are a few minor caveats to keep in mind, however:

 - Archives and copies of HTTP clients will be initialized with an empty operation queue.
 - NSCoding cannot serialize / deserialize block properties, so an archive of an HTTP client will not include any reachability callback block that may be set.

The serializer validates the status code to be in the `2XX` range, denoting success.
