/**
 `AFURLConnectionOperation` is an `NSOperation` that implements NSURLConnection delegate methods.
 
 ## Subclassing Notes
 
 This is the base class of all network request operations. You may wish to create your own subclass in order to implement additional `NSURLConnection` delegate methods (see "`NSURLConnection` Delegate Methods" below), or to provide additional properties and/or class constructors.
 
 If you are creating a subclass that communicates over the HTTP or HTTPS protocols, you may want to consider subclassing `AFHTTPRequestOperation` instead, as it supports specifying acceptable content types or status codes.
 
 ## NSURLConnection Delegate Methods
 
 `AFURLConnectionOperation` implements the following `NSURLConnection` delegate methods:
 
 - `connection:didReceiveResponse:`
 - `connection:didReceiveData:`
 - `connectionDidFinishLoading:`
 - `connection:didFailWithError:`
 - `connection:didSendBodyData:totalBytesWritten:totalBytesExpectedToWrite:`
 - `connection:willCacheResponse:`
 - `connection:canAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpace:`
 - `connection:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge:`
 
 If any of these methods are overridden in a subclass, they _must_ call the `super` implementation first.
  
 ## Class Constructors
 
 Class constructors, or methods that return an unowned (zero retain count) instance, are the preferred way for subclasses to encapsulate any particular logic for handling the setup or parsing of response data. For instance, `AFJSONRequestOperation` provides `JSONRequestOperationWithRequest:success:failure:`, which takes block arguments, whose parameter on for a successful request is the JSON object initialized from the `response data`.
 
 ## Callbacks and Completion Blocks
 
 The built-in `completionBlock` provided by `NSOperation` allows for custom behavior to be executed after the request finishes. It is a common pattern for class constructors in subclasses to take callback block parameters, and execute them conditionally in the body of its `completionBlock`. Make sure to handle cancelled operations appropriately when setting a `completionBlock` (e.g. returning early before parsing response data). See the implementation of any of the `AFHTTPRequestOperation` subclasses for an example of this.
 
 @warning Subclasses are strongly discouraged from overriding `setCompletionBlock:`, as `AFURLConnectionOperation`'s implementation includes a workaround to mitigate retain cycles, and what Apple rather ominously refers to as "The Deallocation Problem" (See http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2109/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010274-CH1-SUBSECTION11)
 
 ## NSCoding & NSCopying Conformance
 
 `AFURLConnectionOperation` conforms to the `NSCoding` and `NSCopying` protocols, allowing operations to be archived to disk, and copied in memory, respectively. However, because of the intrinsic limitations of capturing the exact state of an operation at a particular moment, there are some important caveats to keep in mind:
 
 ### NSCoding Caveats
 
 - Encoded operations do not include any block or stream properties. Be sure to set `completionBlock`, `outputStream`, and any callback blocks as necessary when using `-initWithCoder:` or `NSKeyedUnarchiver`.
 - Operations are paused on `encodeWithCoder:`. If the operation was encoded while paused or still executing, its archived state will return `YES` for `isReady`. Otherwise, the state of an operation when encoding will remain unchanged.
 
 ### NSCopying Caveats
 
 - `-copy` and `-copyWithZone:` return a new operation with the `NSURLRequest` of the original. So rather than an exact copy of the operation at that particular instant, the copying mechanism returns a completely new instance, which can be useful for retrying operations.
 - A copy of an operation will not include the `outputStream` of the original.
 - Operation copies do not include `completionBlock`. `completionBlock` often strongly captures a reference to `self`, which, perhaps surprisingly, would otherwise point to the _original_ operation when copied.
