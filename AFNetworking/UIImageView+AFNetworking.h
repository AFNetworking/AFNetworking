 Creates and enqueues an image request operation, which asynchronously downloads the image from the specified URL, and sets it the request is finished. Any previous image request for the receiver will be cancelled.

 @param failure A block object to be executed when the image request operation finishes unsuccessfully, or that finishes successfully. This block has no return value and takes three arguments: the request sent from the client, the response received from the server, and the error object describing the network or parsing error that occurred.
