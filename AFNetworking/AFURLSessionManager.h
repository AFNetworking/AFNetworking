/**
 `AFURLSessionManager` creates and manages an `NSURLSession` object based on a specified `NSURLSessionConfiguration` object, which conforms to `<NSURLSessionTaskDelegate>`, `<NSURLSessionDataDelegate>`, `<NSURLSessionDownloadDelegate>`, and `<NSURLSessionDelegate>`.

 ## Subclassing Notes

 This is the base class for `AFHTTPSessionManager`, which adds functionality specific to making HTTP requests. If you are looking to extend `AFURLSessionManager` specifically for HTTP, consider subclassing `AFHTTPSessionManager` instead.

 ## NSURLSession & NSURLSessionTask Delegate Methods

 `AFURLSessionManager` implements the following delegate methods:

 ### `NSURLSessionDelegate`

 - `URLSession:didBecomeInvalidWithError:`
 - `URLSession:didReceiveChallenge:completionHandler:`
 - `URLSessionDidFinishEventsForBackgroundURLSession:`

 ### `NSURLSessionTaskDelegate`

 - `URLSession:willPerformHTTPRedirection:newRequest:completionHandler:`
 - `URLSession:task:didReceiveChallenge:completionHandler:`
 - `URLSession:task:didSendBodyData:totalBytesSent:totalBytesExpectedToSend:`
 - `URLSession:task:didCompleteWithError:`

 ### `NSURLSessionDataDelegate`

 - `URLSession:dataTask:didReceiveResponse:completionHandler:`
 - `URLSession:dataTask:didBecomeDownloadTask:`
 - `URLSession:dataTask:didReceiveData:`
 - `URLSession:dataTask:willCacheResponse:completionHandler:`

 ### `NSURLSessionDownloadDelegate`

 - `URLSession:downloadTask:didFinishDownloadingToURL:`
 - `URLSession:downloadTask:didWriteData:totalBytesWritten:totalBytesWritten:totalBytesExpectedToWrite:`
 - `URLSession:downloadTask:didResumeAtOffset:expectedTotalBytes:`

 If any of these methods are overridden in a subclass, they _must_ call the `super` implementation first.

 ## Network Reachability Monitoring

 Network reachability status and change monitoring is available through the `reachabilityManager` property. Applications may choose to monitor network reachability conditions in order to prevent or suspend any outbound requests. See `AFNetworkReachabilityManager` for more details.

 ## NSCoding Caveats

 - Encoded managers do not include any block properties. Be sure to set delegate callback blocks when using `-initWithCoder:` or `NSKeyedUnarchiver`.

 ## NSCopying Caveats

 - `-copy` and `-copyWithZone:` return a new manager with a new `NSURLSession` created from the configuration of the original.
 - Operation copies do not include any delegate callback blocks, as they often strongly captures a reference to `self`, which would otherwise have the unintuitive side-effect of pointing to the _original_ session manager when copied.

 @warning Managers for background sessions must be owned for the duration of their use. This can be accomplished by creating an application-wide or shared singleton instance.
