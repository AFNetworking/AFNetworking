/**
 `AFURLSessionManager` creates and manages an `NSURLSession` object based on a specified `NSURLSessionConfiguration` object, which conforms to `<NSURLSessionTaskDelegate>`, `<NSURLSessionDataDelegate>`, `<NSURLSessionDownloadDelegate>`, and `<NSURLSessionDelegate>`.
 
 ## Subclassing Notes
 
 This is the base class for `AFHTTPClient`, which adds functionality specific to making HTTP requests. If you are looking to extend `AFURLSessionManager` specifically for HTTP, consider subclassing `AFHTTPClient` instead.
 
 ## NSURLSession & NSURLSessionTask Delegate Methods
 
 `AFURLSessionManager` implements the following delegate methods:
 
 ### `NSURLSessionDelegate`
 
 - `URLSession:didBecomeInvalidWithError:`
 - `URLSession:didReceiveChallenge:completionHandler:`

 ### `NSURLSessionTaskDelegate`
 
 - `URLSession:willPerformHTTPRedirection:newRequest:completionHandler:`
 - `URLSession:task:didReceiveChallenge:completionHandler:`
 - `URLSession:task:didSendBodyData:totalBytesSent:totalBytesExpectedToSend:`
 - `URLSession:task:didCompleteWithError:`

 ### `NSURLSessionDataDelegate`
 
 - `URLSession:dataTask:didReceiveResponse:completionHandler:`
 - `URLSession:dataTask:didBecomeDownloadTask:`
 - `URLSession:dataTask:didReceiveData:`
 - `URLSession:dataTask:willCacheResponse:completionHandler:`

 ### `NSURLSessionDownloadDelegate`

 - `URLSession:downloadTask:didFinishDownloadingToURL:`
 - `URLSession:downloadTask:didWriteData:totalBytesWritten:totalBytesWritten:totalBytesExpectedToWrite:`
 - `URLSession:downloadTask:didResumeAtOffset:expectedTotalBytes:`
 
 If any of these methods are overridden in a subclass, they _must_ call the `super` implementation first.
 
 ## NSCoding Caveats
 
 - Encoded managers do not include any block properties. Be sure to set delegate callback blocks when using `-initWithCoder:` or `NSKeyedUnarchiver`.

 ## NSCopying Caveats

 - `-copy` and `-copyWithZone:` return a new manager with a new `NSURLSession` created from the configuration of the original.
 - Operation copies do not include any delegate callback blocks, as they often strongly captures a reference to `self`, which would otherwise have the unintuitive side-effect of pointing to the _original_ session manager when copied.
