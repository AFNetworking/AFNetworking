/**
 ## SSL Pinning Modes

 The following constants are provided by `AFSSLPinningMode` as possible SSL pinning modes.

 enum {
 AFSSLPinningModeNone,
 AFSSLPinningModePublicKey,
 AFSSLPinningModeCertificate,
 }

 `AFSSLPinningModeNone`
 Do not used pinned certificates to validate servers.
 
 `AFSSLPinningModePublicKeyHash`
 Validate host certificates against a set of predefined public key hashes.
 This mode allows to provide backup key(s) in case the primary key gets compromised/lost.
 The pinned hashes are SHA1 hashes of the public keys in the DER format.

 `AFSSLPinningModePublicKey`
 Validate host certificates against public keys of pinned certificates.
 This mode allows to update the  host certificate without updating the app.

 `AFSSLPinningModeCertificate`
 Validate host certificates against pinned certificates.
 In this mode you are required to update the app when updating the host certificate.
 This can lock users out in some cases e.g. you update the app for iOS 8 but there are users on iOS 7.
