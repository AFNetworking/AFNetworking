/**
 `AFHTTPSessionManager` is a subclass of `AFURLSessionManager` with convenience methods for making HTTP requests. When a `baseURL` is provided, requests made with the `GET` / `POST` / et al. convenience methods can be made with relative paths; network reachability is also scoped to the host of the base URL as well.
 
 ## Subclassing Notes
 
 Developers targeting iOS 7 or Mac OS X 10.9 or later that deal extensively with a web service are encouraged to subclass `AFHTTPSessionManager`, providing a class method that returns a shared singleton object on which authentication and other configuration can be shared across the application.
 
 For developers targeting iOS 6 or Mac OS X 10.8 or earlier, `AFHTTPRequestOperationManager` may be used to similar effect.

 ## Methods to Override

 To change the behavior of all data task operation construction, which is also used in the `GET` / `POST` / et al. convenience methods, override `dataTaskWithRequest:completionHandler:`.
 
 ## Serialization
 
 Requests created by an HTTP client will contain default headers and encode parameters according to the `requestSerializer` property, which is an object conforming to `<AFURLRequestSerialization>`.
 
 Responses received from the server are automatically validated and serialized by the `responseSerializers` property, which is an object conforming to `<AFURLResponseSerialization>`

 ## URL Construction Using Relative Paths

 For HTTP convenience methods, the request serializer constructs URLs from the path relative to the `-baseURL`, using `NSURL +URLWithString:relativeToURL:`, when provided. If `baseURL` is `nil`, `path` needs to resolve to a valid `NSURL` object using `NSURL +URLWithString:`.
 
 Below are a few examples of how `baseURL` and relative paths interact:

    NSURL *baseURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example.com/v1/"];
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"foo" relativeToURL:baseURL];                  // http://example.com/v1/foo
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"foo?bar=baz" relativeToURL:baseURL];          // http://example.com/v1/foo?bar=baz
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"/foo" relativeToURL:baseURL];                 // http://example.com/foo
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"foo/" relativeToURL:baseURL];                 // http://example.com/v1/foo
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"/foo/" relativeToURL:baseURL];                // http://example.com/foo/
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example2.com/" relativeToURL:baseURL]; // http://example2.com/

 Also important to note is that a trailing slash will be added to any `baseURL` without one. This would otherwise cause unexpected behavior when constructing URLs using paths without a leading slash.
