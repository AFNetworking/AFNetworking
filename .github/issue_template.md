<!--
Hi, thanks so much for opening an issue! ðŸ¤—

To better pinpoint (and solve) the issue you're experiencing, we could use some information on your behalf.

Please let us know the following things:

- What version of AFNetworking are you using?
- What version of iOS are you running on?
- What version of Swift (if any) are you running on?
- What device(s) are you testing on? Are these simulators?
- Is the issue you're experiencing reproducable in the example app?

In some cases it can be really helpful to provide a short example of your code.
If so, please wrap these code blocks in backticks, like this:

```objective-c
*your code goes here*
```

When referencing a dependency manager-related issue (think CocoaPods, Carthage, SPM), please add its configuration file and version to the issue.
It would be helpful to put the contents in a code block too, using ```ruby for CocoaPods and ```swift for SwiftPM.

Also please make sure your title describes your problem well. Questions end with a question mark.

Thanks again, and let us know if there are any other questions you might have.
